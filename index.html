                    In 2018, I hired Keenen Lucas to install Marley brand floor covering in American Dance Institute's two new Shoreline, Washington dance studios. The total square footage was 2400, as I recall, which is a large job. Keenen was excellent, and as I write this review two years later, it is as good as the day he installed it. What I appreciated about Lucas's work was how organized,  systematic, and exact he was. He did not take short cuts. Every preparational step was taken to make sure our floors were level and smooth and ready to receive the covering. Marley flooring is bulky, heavy, and challenging to install, but Keenan handled it like a pro. He finished on time and on budget. It is easy to imagine that he is this focused and disciplined in all the work he performs. He is a rare, true craftsman. I highly recommend him to you for any project you have in mind. We are opening two new studios soon and I intend to hire him again.
